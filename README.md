# myContacts

This is a Full-Stack application for managing personal contacts. Users can register, log in, and perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on their contact list. The app is built using **React** for the front-end and **Node.js** with **Express** for the back-end.

## Features

- User registration and authentication
- Add, edit, delete, and filter for contacts
- State management with **Redux**
- API integration for back-end communication
- Responsive design for better user experience

## Back-End Hosting Note

The back-end of this application is deployed on **Render.com** using a free plan. As a result:
- The app may take longer to respond during the first request due to server cold start.
- Subsequent requests will have improved performance.
